The provided JavaScript code correctly constructs the prompt for Gemini and prepares the associated data.

Here's a breakdown of why it's good:

1.  **Data Extraction**: It accurately extracts `business_name`, `email`, `phone`, `city`, and `industry` from the `$json` input, falling back to empty strings if not present, which is good practice.
2.  **Slug Generation (`slugBase`)**:
    *   It creates a URL-friendly slug from the business name or industry.
    *   Handles Finnish special characters (`å`, `ä`, `ö`) correctly by converting them to their basic Latin counterparts.
    *   Replaces non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens.
    *   Removes leading/trailing hyphens, ensuring a clean slug.
    *   This is robust and well-implemented.
3.  **Prompt Construction**:
    *   **Clarity**: The prompt text is clear, well-structured, and written in Finnish as requested.
    *   **Dynamic Data**: It correctly interpolates all the business-specific details into the prompt.
    *   **Specific Instructions**:
        *   It explicitly requests HTML5 and Tailwind CSS (via CDN).
        *   It details the required page structure (navigation, hero, services, why us, contact, footer).
        *   **Crucially, it includes the exact `img` tag for the hero section with `src=""` and explicitly instructs Gemini *not* to change it.** This directly addresses the requirement "Käytä aina merkkijonoa hero-kuvan src-attribuutissa. Älä muuta sitä, älä korvaa sitä, älä poista sitä."
        *   It specifies the `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `</html>` first/last lines.
        *   It forbids markdown, JSON, or comments in the output, ensuring a clean HTML response.
    *   **Completeness**: All elements requested in the initial comments are included in the prompt.
4.  **Return Format**: The code returns an array containing a JSON object with the `prompt`, `slug`, and all relevant business details, which is suitable for consumption by an external system that would then pass this prompt to Gemini.

**Conclusion:**

The code is well-written, adheres to all specified requirements, and is ready for use. It effectively translates the input data into a precise and comprehensive prompt for a generative AI model.
