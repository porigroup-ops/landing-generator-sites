This is a well-structured, clean, and modern HTML and CSS code for a business website. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and some minor considerations:

**Strengths:**

1.  **Semantic HTML:** Excellent use of semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and appropriate heading levels (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`). This improves readability, accessibility, and SEO.
2.  **Responsive Design:**
    *   The `viewport` meta tag is correctly included.
    *   The `.hero` image is set to `width: 100%; height: auto;` ensuring it scales well.
    *   CSS Grid (`display: grid`, `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));`) is used effectively for the `.cards` layout, making it inherently responsive and adaptive to different screen sizes.
    *   A media query for `max-width: 600px` is included to adjust `h1` font size and make the button full width, which is a good practice for mobile devices.
3.  **Accessibility (A11y):**
    *   `lang="fi"` attribute is correctly set on the `<html>` tag.
    *   `alt` attribute is provided for the hero image.
    *   Clear and descriptive link text is used.
    *   `tel:` and `mailto:` links are correctly implemented.
    *   Logical heading structure.
    *   Good color contrast for text and button.
4.  **Modern CSS Practices:**
    *   Uses `rem` units for font sizes and padding, which is good for scalability and accessibility.
    *   CSS Grid for card layouts is a robust and flexible approach.
    *   `transition` for button hover effect provides a smooth user experience.
5.  **Code Readability:** The code is well-indented and organized, making it easy to read and maintain.
6.  **Content:** The Finnish content is relevant and well-written for a business "Yritys Oy" offering professional services.

**Minor Considerations/Suggestions (Optional):**

1.  **Focus States:** While browsers provide default focus outlines, it's good practice to define custom `:focus` styles for interactive elements (like buttons and links) to ensure they are clearly visible for keyboard users. For example:
    ```css
    .button:focus,
    a:focus {
      outline: 2px solid #005fa3; /* Or any distinct focus indicator */
      outline-offset: 2px;
    }
    ```
2.  **Header Navigation:** For a more complex site, you might consider adding a navigation menu within the `<header>` element, even if it's just links to the sections within this single page. For this simple page, the "Ota yhteyttä" button suffices as the primary call to action.
3.  **Variable for Main Color:** If the blue color (`#0077cc`, `#005fa3`) is used in many places, defining it as a CSS variable could make it easier to manage and change site-wide.
    ```css
    :root {
      --primary-color: #0077cc;
      --primary-hover-color: #005fa3;
    }
    /* Then use: */
    .button {
      background: var(--primary-color);
    }
    .button:hover {
      background: var(--primary-hover-color);
    }
    ```

**Conclusion:**

This is an excellent example of a well-crafted web page. It demonstrates strong understanding of HTML semantics, CSS best practices, and responsive design principles. The site is clean, functional, and highly accessible. Great job!
